<p class="scrollParagraphComponent">This folder contains numerous Tree Languages.</p>

<p class="scrollParagraphComponent">Some of these languages are just for demonstration and testing purposes.</p>

<p class="scrollParagraphComponent">Some of them are usable. The recommended way to use the languages in the folder is to search the top level <code>products/</code> folder and use the compiled Javascript directly.</p>

<p class="scrollParagraphComponent">The usuable languages include Stamp, Hakon, Stump, Swarm, Grammar and Dumbdown.</p>
